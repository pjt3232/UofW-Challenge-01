# Horiseon: Search Engine Optimizaiton

## Description
My motivation for this project was to learn about skills such as HTML, CSS, and Git flow, so I could better my skills as a beginning developer and build a strong foundation for my future in the field. I built this project to learn more about the search engine optimization tactics found in the content of the page and also work on concepts, such as semantic HTML elements and having a logical structure of HTML and CSS on the backend of the application. This application solves the problem of beginning developers not knowing how to have their application have the best search engine optimization by showing them the skills behind accomplishing that task. The structure of the backend and semantic elements that pairs along with the topics shown on the front end of the application teach these skills to beginning developers. From this project, I learned foundational building blocks about HTML, CSS, and Git flow, as well as how to optimize the amount of users an application reaches using concepts such as semantic HTML elements and logical structuring of elements.
